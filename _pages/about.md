Made With ML exists to end the hype and deliver actual value.

### ðŸ›  Deliver actual value

- <u><i>Problem</i></u>:
So how come there's all this buzz around ML but we grossly fall short when it comes to deployed ML in real world applications.
There are many reasons for this, including but not limited to:
  - *data*: not enough of the right data (most are static but we need streaming).
  - *cost*: the compute, storage and talent resources needed for ML allow [mostly](https://www.wired.com/story/companies-rushing-use-ai-few-see-payoff/) large companies to benefit from it.
  - *utility*: most ML content you see online are gimmicky tasks that can't extend into valuable real world applications.
  - *trust*: ML needs to be engineered reliably and robustly.

- <u><i>Solution</i></u>:
We will steadily address all the issues mentioned above but we're going to work backwards starting with *trust*.
This is why we created our [Courses]({% link _courses/index.md %}) page to educate the community on how to responsibly develop, deploy and maintain applications that are made with ML.
