Learn the foundations of machine learning with intuition, visuals and clean code. These are *not* quick ML tutorials. We cover each concept in depth and walk-through from intuition to inference.

<h2><u>FAQ</u></h2>

#### Who is this course for?
- Anyone looking to develop a solid foundation of the math and code behind machine learning.

#### What is the structure?
Lessons will be released weekly and each one will include:
- `intuition`: high level overview of the concepts that will be covered and how it all fits together.
- `code`: simple code examples to illustrate the concept.
- `visualizations`: illustrative visualizations to make concepts very clear.

#### What makes this course unique?
- `intuition-first`: We will never jump straight to code. In every lesson, we will develop intuition for the concepts and think about it from a high level.
- `software engineering`: This course isn't just about ML. In fact, it's mostly about clean software engineering! We'll cover important concepts like object oriented programming to deliver code that can scale.

#### Who is the author?
- I've deployed large scale ML systems at Apple as well as smaller systems with constraints at startups and want to share the common principles I've learned along the way.
- I created Made With ML so that the community can explore, learn and build ML and I learned how to build it into an end-to-end product that's currently used by over 20K monthly active users.
- Connect with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/GokuMohandas" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-twitter ai-color-info mr-1"></i>Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/goku" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-linkedin ai-color-primary mr-1"></i>LinkedIn</a>

#### Why is this free?
While this is for everyone, this content is especially targeted towards people who don't have as much opportunity to learn around the world. I firmly believe that creativity and intelligence are randomly distributed but opportunity is siloed. I want to enable more people to create and contribute to innovation.
