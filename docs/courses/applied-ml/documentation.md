Documenting code for your users and your future self.

## Intuition

## Code

### Typing
So far we've worked inside IPython notebooks where we're working quickly and experimenting. But now it's important to take the time to be very explicit with our code. Besides using explicit variable, function (underscores) and class (CamelCase) names we can also specify the input and output variable's types in functions, also known as [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html){:target="_blank"}.

### Docstring
We're also going to take time and document our functions a bit.

!!! tip
    If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} (highly recommend), you can type `"""` under a function and then hit the ++shift++ key to generate a template docstring.
