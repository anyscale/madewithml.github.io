**Subject**: Reimbursement for Made With ML's MLOps Course

Hi,

Hope you're doing well. I was recently accepted into [Made With ML's MLOps course](https://madewithml.com/mlops-course){:target="_blank"}, which is a 4-week project-based course on MLOps fundamentals. The course costs $850 / $1500 but the value I'll gain for myself and our team/company will pay for the course almost immediately. I added some key information about the course below and would love to get this career development opportunity reimbursed.

<u>Course page</u>: [https://madewithml.com/mlops-course](https://madewithml.com/mlops-course){:target="_blank"}

### What is the course?

A 4-week project based course to learn the fundamentals of MLOps. It focuses on helping me develop an intuition as opposed to being a rigid course that uses a very specific set of tools. At the same time, it's <u>extremely hands-on</u> where I'll learn proper software engineering practices and implement all the MLOps concepts I learn. It's tool, stack and cloud provider agnostic, so I'll easily be able to extend what I learn to our systems.

This course brings all of the MLOps best practices into one place, allowing me to quickly (and properly) learn it. And best of all, the classes are during the weekend or after work, so I <u>won't be missing any work</u>.

Here's a quick look at the curriculum:

### Who's teaching the course?

The course is from Made With ML, who has the [top MLOps repository](https://github.com/topics/mlops){:target="_blank"} on GitHub (26K+ stars), a quickly [growing community](https://newsletter.madewithml.com/){:target="_blank"} (30K+) and is a [highly recommended](https://youtu.be/VSC7WBFMuZo?t=1000){:target="_blank"} resource used by industry. Their content not only covers MLOps concepts but they go deep into actually implementing all of them as well.

### How will this help me?

I'll be learning the foundation I need to responsibly deliver value with ML systems. This includes producing clean, production-grade code, testing my work, understanding MLOps components (experiment management, feature store, workflows, etc.) and, most importantly, being able to iterate and improve our systems.

### How will this help our company?

What I learn will directly translate to better quality ML systems in our products. I'll also be able to engage in conversations with peers and management as we traverse this nascent space to build what's right for us. And, most important of all, I'll be able to pass on what I learn as I collaborate with others in our team so we're all working towards building reliable ML systems.

Thank you
