## üåç &nbsp;Deliver value

There's a lot of buzz around ML but we grossly fall short when it comes to responsibly deploying ML in real world applications. There are many reasons for this, including but not limited to:

- `#!js data`: not enough of the right data.
- `#!js cost`: the data, compute, storage and talent resources needed for ML allow [mostly](https://www.wired.com/story/companies-rushing-use-ai-few-see-payoff/){:target="_blank"} large companies to benefit from it.
- `#!js utility`: most ML content you see online are trite tasks that can't extend into valuable real world applications.
- `#!js trust`: ML needs to be engineered reliably and robustly.

We will steadily address all the issues mentioned above but we're going to work backwards starting with *trust*.
This is why we created our courses to educate the community on how to responsibly develop, deploy and maintain production applications that are *made with ML*.
